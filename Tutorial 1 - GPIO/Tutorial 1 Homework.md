# GPIO Homework

**Note:** Finish your homework and demonstrate the program in CYT Rm3007B to any of the software seniors before your next tutorial session.

**Construct a program that contains different modes and fulfills the following requirments:**

### Normal Mode: Binary digit operation [60 pts]

The three LEDs represent three bits.</br>
Initially, the value is 0, i.e. all LEDs are off.

- Button 1 will perform increment. i.e. the value will be increased by 1. E.g. 010 -> 011, 011 -> 100 (binary)
- Button 2 will flip the bits left and right. i.e. all the bits will be reversed. E.g. 001 -> 100, 100 -> 001 (binary)
- Button 3 will perform left shift. i.e. all bits moved to the left by 1 bit, the rightmost bit will be filled by 0. E.g. 011 -> 110, 001 -> 010 (binary)
- Holding Button 1 and Button 2 for 2 seconds will reset the value to 0.

### Special Mode: Driving up the wall [40 pts]
- When a button is clicked thrice within 1 second, it would be considered a triple-click.
- If Button 2 is triple-clicked, enter Special Mode. ***[20 pts]***
  - The first two clicks are going to do flip the bits left and right, so the value wouldn't be changed (reverse, then reverse back). However, the board will go into Special Mode when Button 2 is pressed for the third time; and the value should not be altered.
- In Special Mode, the LEDs should repeat this sequence `n` times, with `n` being the value in Normal mode (e.g. Value is 101 (binary), then the sequence will repeat 5 times):
  - Keep silent for 500ms, meanwhile display the 3-bit value with the LEDs.
  - Beep with the buzzer for 500ms, turn off all LEDs.
- After the sequence ends, return to Normal Mode automatically.
- Your demo ends here if you choose not to do Bonus Mode.

### Bonus Mode: Stupid lock [20/30 pts]
- In Normal Mode, when Button 1 and Button 3 are held together for 2 seconds, it will go into Bonus Mode.
- The initial state when entering Bonus Mode should be The Hint Sequence.

#### The Password
- The password is a sequence of keystrokes.
- The default password should be Button 1 -> Button 2 -> Button 3.
- You have 2 options for implementing the password.
  - **A:** Fixed length with 3 keystrokes. **[10 pts]**
  - **B:** Variable length up to 8 keystrokes. **[20 pts]**
  
#### State: Changing the Password
- To make your device secure, it's very important to change your password frequently. To change the password, while in The Hint Sequence state, you shall hold all three buttons together for 2 seconds. After that, you should hear a beep sound that last for 100 ~ 500ms to indicate you have entered the changing password mode.
- Depend on your option, implement the following:
  - **Plan A:** Press the three buttons in any order (shall not be repeated, repeated keystrokes should be ignored). After the sequence is completed, enter The Hint Sequence state automatically.
  - **Plan B:** Press the three buttons in any order, the same button can be pressed more than once this time. If you have already entered 8 keystrokes, it should enter The Hint Sequence state automatically. Or if you want to set a password shorter than 8 keystrokes, you should hold all three button for 2 seconds in order to go to The Hint Sequence state.

#### State: The Hint Sequence
- Sometimes, it's very hard for you to remember all the password that you have created since you were young. Therefore, it's a good practice to leave some hints for yourself to open the lock :D
- LEDs should blink to reveal the sequence of the password. E.g. the password is Button 1 -> Button 2 -> Button 3, then the LEDs shall **repeat** the following sequence:
  1. LED 1 turn on
  2. LED 1 turn off
  3. LED 2 turn on
  4. LED 2 turn off
  5. LED 3 turn on
  6. LED 3 turn off
- Each steps should last around 100 ~ 500ms.
- Longer password works the same way.
- You may blink all LEDs once in sync to indicate the end of a cycle, before starting the next loop (optional, for your convenience only when demoing).

#### Back to Normal
- While in The Hint Sequence State, if you entered the password correctly, the device should go back to Normal Mode.
- Your demo ends here if you choose to do the Bonue Mode.
- *Hint: Make it so that for a password of length `n`, ignore all inputs that are more than `n` inputs ago. This way if you pressed a wrong button, you can immedately start over without any additional steps.*


**Remark:**
- The Bonus Mode is an optional task. You should finish the Normal Mode and Special Mode before challenging yourself. **No mark** will be given in Bonus Mode if you haven't completed the above modes.
- There is two task in Bonus Mode, which they shouldn't be coexist. Thus, you can only choose to do either one of the task in a single demonstration.
- Plan A is easier than Plan B, you should choose to do which task base on your ability.
